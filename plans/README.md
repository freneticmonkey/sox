# Plans Directory

This directory contains implementation plans generated by AI agents for the Sox programming language project.

## Purpose

The `plans/` folder is used to store detailed implementation plans before executing significant changes to the codebase. These plans help:

- Document the approach for complex features
- Review implementation strategy before coding
- Track architectural decisions
- Provide context for future maintenance

## Plan Structure

Each plan should include:

1. **Objective** - What the plan aims to accomplish
2. **Current State** - Relevant existing implementation details
3. **Proposed Changes** - Step-by-step implementation approach
4. **Files Affected** - List of files that will be modified/created
5. **Testing Strategy** - How the changes will be validated
6. **Risks/Considerations** - Potential issues or edge cases

## Naming Convention

Plans should be named descriptively with the date:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md
YYYY-MM-DD-bugfix-description.md
YYYY-MM-DD-refactor-component.md
```

Examples:
- `2025-11-28-implement-garbage-collection.md`
- `2025-11-28-add-import-system.md`
- `2025-11-28-optimize-string-interning.md`

## Usage

1. Before implementing a significant feature, create a plan document
2. Review the plan for completeness and correctness
3. Execute the implementation following the plan
4. Update the plan if the implementation deviates significantly
5. Archive or remove plans once implementation is complete (optional)

## Example Plan Template

```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
